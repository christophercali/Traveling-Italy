    <p>Italian heritage is a very important part of my identity. I have been fortunate enough to travel to Italy multiple times with my family and through a study abroad program.
      
      In an effort to document these experiences, I have created an interactive overview of my travels, which I hope is engaging and interesting. View images that capture my favorite parts of each Italian city. Explore the country further with the map.</p>
